Spectral code for finding the eigenvalue spectrum of the Orr Sommerfeld equation.

OS.m 		=> Orr Sommerfeld equation in the primitive variables
OS_2.m		=> velocity-vorticity formulation, as given in Schmid and Henningson, chapter 3

getD.m		=> Create Chebyechev differentiation matrices
dummyDo.m	=> Create Chebyechev differentiation matrices	
find_and_sort.m	=> takes matrices A and B, solves the generalized eigenvalue problem Ax=omega*Bx and then sorts the eigenvalues according to decreasing imaginary parts
